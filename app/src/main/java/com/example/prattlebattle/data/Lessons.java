However, it shouldn’t be confused with arrogance and entitlement; they are not genuine forms of confidence and can be detrimental to interpersonal relationships.

You should let go of the idea that you should be the perfect, overachieving individual, which is the opposite of who you are now. We are humans, by default we are flawed and may mess up sometimes. From now on, whenever you make a mistake, don’t disown everything about yourself. Rather, reflect and find a way not to repeat it. Think of yourself as a friend; If a friend is feeling down, you will cheer them up instead of making them feel worse, right? \n",  R.raw.a2),

There are certain taken-for-granted cultural values about what makes a person worthwhile. For example, if you are a lady, you should have a husband and kids to be successful. The thing is, we live in the 21st century, where acceptance towards various personalities and life paths is increasing. Think about these prejudices for a second and evaluate whether they will truly make you happy or you are following them just because you “should”.\n",  R.raw.a3),

You need to address what makes you feel worthless and strive to improve it with confidence. When having core self-esteem, you will approach these problems with the mindset that you CAN fix them. Reassure yourself that you are capable, and with hard work and patience, you will achieve your goals. \n",  R.raw.a4),

For example, in early childhood, we recognize a distinction between the sounds of the parents' voices – the father's voice varies from the mother's. This ability evolves from childhood to adulthood and increases as we gain more life experience. As adults, not only can we recognize different voices, but we also notice subtle variations in the way sounds are produced. For example, we can recognize by the tone of someone’s voice that they are sad, even if they are telling us otherwise. Therefore, this type of listening is crucial for understanding the real meaning of the speaker's words. \n",  R.raw.a16),

Our ability to interpret information and formulate our thoughts about the world around us, as well as weigh the pros and cons to make an informed decision, influences our lives significantly. That is why critical listening is essential for true learning.

However, it is not the same as sympathy (being compassionate or feeling sorry for someone); empathy entails a deeper relation – an understanding and appreciation of another person's viewpoint. It is a valuable trait in many interpersonal relationships; you would feel more at ease discussing your feelings with someone who shows empathy than someone who doesn't. This type of listening means comprehending the speaker's true feelings by putting yourself in their shoes.
